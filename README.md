In this application I learned how to use basic javscript functions to manipulate the DOM and dynamically render data to the page. I used click based functions for incrementation and tracking.

In this checkpoint students will demonstrate their understanding of working with the DOM and dynamically rendering data to the page. They will be responsible for writing functions to handle input and styling the page utilizing Bootstrap best practices to design the page.
